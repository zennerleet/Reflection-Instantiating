# Reflection-Instantiating


This Java project exemplifies the concept of instantiang an object of a class which is loaded on runtime



The program searches for .class files in the passc2/Objects directory, instantiates them and displays them on the screen.
There is a video attached demonstrating the behavior.

You can use UP_ARROW and DOWN_ARROW to increment or decrement the value of the maximum number of elements that can be drawn on the screen. 
Use space to reset that number to 0.
